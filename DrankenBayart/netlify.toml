This file tells Netlify/Vercel how to handle routing for Single Page Applications (SPAs)

The rule below ensures that all requests for paths that don't match a file

are rewritten (redirected) to index.html. This allows React Router (or in our case,

React's internal state management) to handle the URL, preventing 404 errors

when a user refreshes the page or navigates directly to a sub-path.
